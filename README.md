# StreambaDemoClientside
An Electron/React front-end for a Retail Management system

Built using React, Electron and thoroughly leaning on Material-UI templates and examples for its looks. 

Instructions(Windows): Assuming you have npm installed, navigate to /StreambaDemoClientside and run 'npm install' to download dependencies, then run 'npm run electron-dev'. Might take a second but this should start the app.

-Running on Mac should be the same. 

From there, login with username 'streamba' and password 'streambapassword' and then have a look around. If anything crashes at any point, (hopefully not!) then try Ctrl+r to refresh the page. You can also use Ctrl+SHIFT+i to view the console log if you wish, I've likely left a bunch in there!

Feel free to email me if you have any problems!
